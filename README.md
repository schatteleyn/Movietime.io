When you're running out of idea to watch a movie, you can use movietime.cc that gives you a list of 10 great movies.  
When you want to download the movie, you can use the great movie.io.  
And to do all of this at once, you can use this ruby program.  
Enjoy !  
  
The only bug for now is when there is several movies after the search on movies.io. I'm trying to find a way to parse the result page to let the user choose the movie.
