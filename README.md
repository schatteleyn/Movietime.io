When you're running out of idea to watch a movie, you can use movietime.cc that gives you a list of 10 great movies.  
When you want to download the movie, you can use the great movie.io.  
And to do all of this at once, you can use this ruby program.  
Enjoy !  

NB:

If you are on Linux, you have to change the 'open' command at the line 46 by the command to open your torrent downloader. Open is a mac OS X command.  
The API of movies.io is still under development so don't blame me if you don't find the movie :D
