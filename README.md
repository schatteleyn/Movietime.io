When you're running out of idea to watch a movie, you can use movietime.cc that gives you a list of 10 great movies.  
When you want to download the movie, you can use the great movies.io.  
And to do all of this at once, you can use this ruby program.  
Enjoy !  

NB:

If you are on Linux, you have to change the 'open' command by the command to open your torrent downloader and your browser (in case there's no response from the API). Open is a mac OS X command.  
If the API send an error message, the script automatically open the browser on the search page of movies.io.  
The API of movies.io is still under development so don't blame me if you don't find the movie :D
